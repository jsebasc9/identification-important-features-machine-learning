# Identification important features machine learning

Individual Project Machine Learning and Visualisation Assignment to develop statistical analysis and find important features for machine learning algorithm

The implementation required to design and develop the related programs.

identificationFeatures.R: startin by preparing and cleaning the data, then run compare and visualise the behaviour of the data, and finally found the three mmain features for the model.

This program include dataset in .csv file and it was implemented with different programming concepts, including data types, control structures with cycles and conditional statmens
for visualisation analysis in R language
